# ISSUES (Append-only section-based log)

Entries record newly discovered requests or changes, with their outcomes. No instructive content lives here. Read @NOTES.md for the process to follow when fixing issues.

Read @AGENTS.md, @AGENTS.GO.md, @AGENTS.DOCKER.md, @AGENTS.FRONTEND.md, @AGENTS.GIT.md, @POLICY.md, @NOTES.md, @README.md and @ISSUES.md. Start working on open issues. Work autonomously and stack up PRs.

Each issue is formatted as `- [ ] [<ID>-<number>]`. When resolved it becomes `- [x] [<ID>-<number>]`.

Issue IDs in Features, Improvements, BugFixes, and Maintenance never reuse completed numbers; cleanup renumbers remaining entries so numbering stays monotonic.
## Features (111–199)
## Improvements (261–299)
## BugFixes (345–399)
## Maintenance (400–499)
## Planning (do not implement yet) (450–499)
