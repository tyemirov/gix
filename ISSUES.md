# ISSUES
**Append-only section-based log**

Entries record newly discovered requests or changes, with their outcomes. No instructive content lives here. Read @NOTES.md for the process to follow when fixing issues.

Read @AGENTS.md, @AGENTS.GO.md, @AGENTS.GIT.md @ARCHITECTURE.md, @POLICY.md, @NOTES.md,  @README.md and @ISSUES.md. Start working on open issues. Work autonomously and stack up PRs.

Each issue is formatted as `- [ ] [GX-<number>]`. When resolved it becomes -` [x] [GX-<number>]`

## Features (110–199)

## Improvements (251–299)

- [ ] [GX-251] `gix cd` doesnt work with --stash flag the way I would like it to: I want it to stash the modified tracked files, switch to the destination branch and restore the files.

## BugFixes (340–399)

## Maintenance (422–499)

## Planning 
**Do not work on these, not ready**

- [ ] Add an ability to rollback changes. Make flows and complex commands transactional to allow for rollback when a flow that changes things fails
