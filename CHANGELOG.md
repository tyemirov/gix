## [v0.2.0-rc.11]

### Features ✨
- Added `append-if-missing` file mode for workflow-managed files to append missing lines without overwriting existing content, ideal for `.gitignore` enforcement.
- Renamed legacy `line-edit` mode to `append-if-missing` with backward compatibility acceptance and new `ensure-lines` file mode added.
- Introduced reusable `pkg/llm` package for large language model integrations with lightweight interfaces and configurable HTTP plumbing.

- Enhanced testing coverage for task planning and execution of the new file modes, ensuring correct behavior and idempotence.
- Added detailed documentation for `pkg/llm` explaining configuration, usage, and design principles.
- Decomposed the workflow executor into discrete actions (`git.branch.prepare`, `files.apply`, `git.stage`, `git.commit`, `git.push`, `pull-request.create`) with reusable guard helpers so file edits, commits, and pushes run independently and emit precise failures.
- Added first-class workflow commands for each action (`git stage`, `git commit`, `git stage-commit`, `git push`, `pull-request create`, `pull-request open`) plus per-task `steps` configuration, enabling workflows to orchestrate small git/file operations explicitly (see the updated gitignore workflow).
- Shell command failures now report the invoked arguments and the first line of stderr, making `git`/`gh` workflow errors actionable.

### Bug Fixes 🐛
- Fixed legacy mode acceptance issues by supporting the renamed `append-if-missing` mode in parser and executor components.
- `gix workflow` now executes workflow operations directly, so git action steps such as `git stage-commit` run without triggering “unsupported workflow command” errors (the gitignore preset works again).
- `branch.change` no longer attempts to create new automation branches with `--track origin/<branch>` when the remote ref does not exist, allowing presets like `gitignore` to create/push fresh branches without invalid reference errors.
- `append-if-missing` now normalizes carriage-return line endings before evaluating and applying changes so templates written on Windows append every line instead of collapsing into a single entry.
- `append-if-missing` now compares literal line content (whitespace intact) so `.envrc`, `*.env`, or indented variants no longer satisfy the `.env` check and prevent the line from being appended.
- Repository-scoped `TASK_SKIP` events (for example, dirty worktrees) now propagate a skip sentinel so later workflow steps stop executing against that repository instead of running `git stage-commit`/push commands on a repo that was already skipped.
- Removed verbose per-stage workflow logging so only the final summary is printed when running `gix workflow`.
- Added concise workflow logging that groups events per repository, collapses `TASK_PLAN`/`TASK_APPLY` noise, and highlights warnings/errors without the previous wall of text.
- `branch.change` no longer runs `git pull --rebase` immediately after creating a brand new local branch without a tracking remote, eliminating spurious `PULL-SKIP` warnings during workflows.

### Testing 🧪
- Added comprehensive unit tests for parsing task file modes including the new `append-if-missing`.
- Added tests verifying task planner skips when lines are already present and executor correctly appends missing lines only.
- Expanded integration tests for task executor's append-if-missing functionality in workflow-managed files.

### Docs 📚
- Documented `append-if-missing` mode in README, schema highlights, and CLI command descriptions with examples.

- Folded the `branch-refresh` behaviour into `gix cd` via `--refresh`/`--stash`/`--commit` flags and removed the standalone command while preserving migration warnings for legacy configuration.
- Renamed the `branch-default` command to `default`, added workflow/config alias warnings, and updated CLI defaults, docs, and workflow tests to reference the new surface while keeping `branch-default` as an alias.
- Introduced a top-level `message` namespace and moved `changelog message` to `message changelog`, keeping the legacy path as a deprecated alias with config/CLI warnings.
- Added embedded workflow presets so `gix workflow --list-presets` and `gix workflow <preset>` can run bundled automation (initially `license`) without a separate YAML file.
- Added workflow runtime variables (`gix workflow --var key=value` / `--var-file path.yaml`) so presets and file-based configs can consume user-supplied values.
- Added an `append-if-missing` file mode for workflow-managed files so recipes like the gitignore preset can append missing entries without overwriting existing content.
- Deprecated `gix repo-license-apply` in favor of the `workflow license` preset; the CLI prints a warning and forwards legacy flags as workflow variables.
- Removed the remaining legacy CLI wrappers (`gix commit`, `gix changelog`, and `gix repo-license-apply`) along with the configuration alias/warning layer so only the canonical namespaces remain.
- Moved history purge under `gix files rm` and removed the legacy `gix rm` command, updating configuration defaults/docs/tests to the new namespace.
- Added an embedded `namespace` preset and removed the `gix namespace rewrite` CLI; `gix workflow namespace` is now the single supported entrypoint.
- Added explicit `make test-fast`/`test-slow` targets (with `ci` wiring) so fast unit packages can run independently of the slower `./tests` integration suite.

### Testing 🧪
- Added unit coverage for branch change task actions to verify repository-default and configured fallback branch resolution.
- Expanded workflow command coverage to exercise preset execution, preset listing, runtime variable parsing, and the reusable configuration parser.
- Refactored integration Git fixtures into shared helpers (stubbed GH binary builder + git repository factory), updated repos/no-remote suites to reuse them, and added tests ensuring the helpers create remotes and PATH stubs correctly.

- Updated `workflow` help text to surface the required configuration path and example usage.
- Disabled default CLI info logging and set the default log level to `error` so commands run silently unless verbosity is explicitly requested.
- Downgraded the configuration initialization banner to DEBUG so standard operations continue logging at INFO severity only.
- Clarified the remote owner constraint skip message to spell out the required `--owner` value and detected repository owner.
- Allowed canonical remote updates to proceed regardless of the configured `--owner` constraint, supporting repositories that migrated between accounts.
- Added `SKIP (already normalized)` messaging to `folder rename` so re-running normalization reports repositories that already match canonical naming.

## [v0.0.8] - 2025-10-07

### Features ✨
- Added a `branch-refresh` command that fetches, checks out, and pulls branches with optional recovery strategies and clean-worktree enforcement.
- Introduced a root `--version` flag that prints the detected gix version and exits before executing subcommands.

### Improvements ⚙️
- Branch refresh now survives intermediate rebase checkpoints by attempting to recover from checkpoint commits.
- Version output messages use the `gix` prefix for consistent CLI presentation.

### Bug Fixes 🐛
- `repo-prs-purge` prompts before deleting branches, respecting `--yes`, apply-to-all decisions, and reuse of confirmations during batch cleanup.
- Nested Git repositories are renamed before their parents during directory normalization to avoid conflicting rename sequences.

## [v0.0.7] - 2025-10-06

### Improvements ⚙️
- Guarded destructive repo-prs-purge operations behind confirmation prompts, centralizing apply-all handling and `--yes` defaults.
- Updated AGENTS and configuration guidance to minimize unnecessary output streaming.

### Testing 🧪
- Expanded coverage for nested rename ordering, branch cleanup prompting, and integration workflows.

## [v0.0.6] - 2025-10-06

### Highlights
- Audit reports now surface non-repository directories with `--all` while presenting folder names relative to their configured roots for quicker scanning.
- Root sanitization trims nested duplicates so CLI commands and workflows operate on a predictable set of repositories.

### Features ✨
- Added an `--all` toggle to `audit` to include top-level directories lacking Git metadata, filling Git-specific columns with `n/a` in CSV output and workflow reports.

### Improvements ⚙️
- Reordered audit CSV columns to lead with `folder_name` and emit paths relative to each root, preserving canonical-name checks through the basename.
- Centralized root sanitation to deduplicate nested entries, expand tildes, and enforce the new singular `--root` flag across commands and workflows.
- Surfaced usage guidance whenever `audit` is invoked without required roots to clarify flag expectations.

### Bug Fixes 🐛
- Corrected repository containment detection so nested Git repositories are not skipped when scanning with `--all`.

### Docs 📚
- Expanded installation guidance and refreshed flag examples in `README.md` to reflect the singular `--root` flag and new audit behaviors.

### CI & Maintenance
- Updated the release workflow to build and publish the `gix` binary from this repository.

## [v0.0.5] - 2025-10-06

### Highlights
- CLI configuration discovery now honors `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` while normalizing resolved paths for consistent behavior across platforms and tests.

### Improvements ⚙️
- Updated the application bootstrap to expand XDG-aware configuration search paths and align emitted logs with the resolved directories.

### Testing 🧪
- Normalized temporary path expectations in repository and application tests so macOS `/private` prefixes no longer cause false negatives.

## [v0.0.4] - 2025-10-03

### Highlights
- Owner-aware repository rename workflows create missing owner directories and keep remotes aligned with canonical metadata.
- Boolean CLI toggles now accept yes/no/on/off forms everywhere thanks to shared parsing utilities.
- Operations audit reliably writes reports into nested output directories without manual setup.

### Features ✨
- Added an `--owner` toggle to `repo-folders-rename`, planned via a new directory planner that joins owner and repository segments and ensures parent directories exist.
- Propagated owner preferences through workflow configuration and remote update execution, including owner-constraint enforcement when rewriting origin URLs.
- Introduced reusable toggle flag helpers that register boolean flags accepting multiple literal forms and normalize command-line arguments before parsing.
- Added an `--all` flag to `audit` so directories without Git metadata appear in reports with git fields marked as `n/a`.

### Improvements ⚙️
- Normalized toggle arguments across commands so `--flag value` and `--flag=value` behave consistently for all boolean options.
- Refined rename workflow execution to skip no-op renames and to honor include-owner preferences sourced from configuration files.
- Ensured audit operations create nested target directories before emitting CSV reports.

### Docs 📚
- Documented owner-aware rename and remote update options in `README.md` and `docs/cli_design.md` examples.

### CI & Maintenance
- Added extensive unit coverage for toggle parsing, rename planners and executors, remote owner constraints, and workflow inspection helpers.

## [v0.0.3] - 2025-10-03

### Highlights
- Added a configuration initialization workflow that writes embedded defaults to either local or user scopes.

## [v0.0.2] - 2025-10-03

### Highlights
- Standardized global CLI flags so `--roots`, `--preview`, `--yes`, and `--require-clean` behave consistently across commands.
- Embedded configuration defaults and extended search paths improve out-of-the-box repository discovery.
- Enhanced branch and audit workflows with cleaner logging defaults and additional safeguards.

### Features ✨
- Enabled a shared root-resolution context that exposes `--roots` on every command and centralizes flag handling.
- Added `--from` and `--to` options for branch migration, alongside enforceable clean-worktree checks for branch-level operations.
- Embedded default configuration content into the binary and merged it with user configuration files discovered on disk.

### Improvements ⚙️
