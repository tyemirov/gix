# ISSUES
**Active backlog (open issues only)**

Resolved issues are archived in `issues.md/ARCHIVE.md`.

Each issue is formatted as `- [ ] [GX-<number>]`.

## Features (110–199)

## Improvements (251–299)

## BugFixes (340–399)

- [ ] [GX-345] First output appears late when running gix against 20–30 repositories because repository discovery/inspection emits no user-facing progress until the first repository finishes its first workflow step. (Unresolved: stream discovery/inspection progress or emit an initial discovery step summary.)

## Maintenance (422–499)

- [ ] [GX-423] Cleanup:
  1. Review the completed issues and compare the code against the README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md files.
  2. Update the README.md and ARCHITECTURE.
  3. Clean up the completed issues.

## Planning
**Do not work on these, not ready**

- [ ] Add an ability to rollback changes. Make flows and complex commands transactional to allow for rollback when a flow that changes things fails
